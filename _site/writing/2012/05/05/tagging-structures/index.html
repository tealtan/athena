    </h2>
    <h3>&mdash; May 2012</h3>
    <p><em>A sketch of the cobbled-together tagging structure of my Pinboard bookmarks, elaborating on <a href='http://storify.com/tealtan/bookmarks-tagging-and-taxonomies'>this conversation</a>. It is shaped from the way I save and retrieve things for later use.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The primary goal is retrieval. There’s already four cues I can rely on when I&#8217;m trying to pull something I saved back out: the title, the URL, the highlights, and the timestamp. These are all highly specific, and if I have a clear memory of the thing, I’ll find it before I need to look at the tags.</p>

<p>So: the tags must work for when my recollection is hazy&#8212;I&#8217;m likely browsing, not searching. I&#8217;ll look at a tag collection, and then narrow down the results with more precise tags until I find it. Tags have cascading levels of specificity: publishing &gt; journalism &gt; reading &gt; narrative, for example, letting me jump in at whatever scale that I can remember. A useful rule-of-thumb is to name these tags what I’m likely to search for later, which sometimes feels like future sight.</p>
<img src='/img/posts/tagging1.png' />
<p>As fallback, I have 10 tags at the top level: technology, education, life, publishing, political, society, design, history, art, and food. Some of these things overlap, and that&#8217;s ok: they reflect the way I mentally sort what I find and read. Everything should be tagged at least one of these lead tags, and they are the starting points when I remember almost nothing about what I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<hr /><img class='side-right small-hide' src='/img/posts/tagging2.png' />
<p>This gives me a naming framework at the moment of tagging, too: I start with the lead tag and then describe the bookmark with broad categories, gradually getting more specific (the same way one would carve at sculpture), and then I skim through the article and my highlights again to add any individual triggers: names and highly specific concepts tend to be dropped in here. Specific uses (say, shopping) or projects also come at the end.</p>

<p>The triggers at the end of each tag chain aren&#8217;t useful as filters for browsing, but they serve other functions: if I go to the page of items tagged technology (which is pretty vague), the hyper-specific tags give me a good idea of what&#8217;s in it. So they&#8217;re useful as an overview tool, when I want to know what’s in a broad category without reading through all my highlights.</p>
<hr />
<p>How granular a particular tag actually is can change as time passes. If I’m interested in the subject and do deeper research, what was once a pretty specific tag (say, London) becomes a broad roof that houses many more discrete ideas.</p>

<p>This allows for frequent and quick reflection: after a few hours of digging into things about London, I can go to the London tag page and get a sweeping overview of what I found, with the broader ideas emerging pretty clearly from the number of items with the same tag. This is also a good time to combine similarly worded tags: such as <em>ships</em> with <em>boats</em> if it looks like I was just using the two terms interchangeably.</p>
<hr />
<p>The cascade structure lets me roughly see what level of granularity I&#8217;m at, just by glancing at the order of the tags in an individual bookmark. I find this fuzzy but clear enough to not need hierarchical tagging in Pinboard.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a continuously evolving system: my bookmarks from even half a year ago looks different from my bookmarks now. This sometimes gives me trouble when I get confused by things tagged out of order, or by outdated naming conventions (I try to tag all people names as <em>firstname-lastname</em> now). So, careful and diligent pruning is necessary to keep this system coherent.</p>
