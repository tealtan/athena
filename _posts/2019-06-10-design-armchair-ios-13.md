iOS improvements

### Nick Heer

- set new standard for how iOS and Mac apps should look and behave, e.g. more swipe gestures, fluid animations, long-press vs 3D Touch, hold and release should work on actions

### From Craig Mod

- Little things, like cursor focus, predictability of app-switching

### My own wishlist

- More thought on status bar, multi-tasking ui (should take more cues from picture-in-picture, chat-heads)
- Idea for better drag and drop gesture (two finger hold)
- Apple’s approach in gating power features behind hardware (pencil, mouse)
- Write up idea around projects/workspaces/folders/shortcuts/tags as alternative to standard file system
- Should be able to screenshot a scrolling view: I swear to god, I never thought they’d support this.

### Opportunity

- identity layer, as way of supporting collaboration, iMessage, Apple Pay
