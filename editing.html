<h2>Assistant editor at <a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/">Contents</a></h2>

  <p>Gathering, producing, applying, and preserving <em>knowledge</em> for people's benefit, as noted by the 
    <a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/editors-letter-no-1/">inaugural Editors&rsquo; Letter</a>, is the 
    domain of many adjacent fields. It's no surprise that the diverse community of content-strategists come 
    from them. Contents doubles down on this richness, in the hopes that the sharing between disciplines will 
    lead to a healthy skepticism and thoughtfulness to one's own work.</p>

<p>Here's a selection of pieces that demonstrate the breadth of the magazine:
  <ul>
    <li>Mandy Brown, <a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/babies-and-the-bathwater/">Babies and the Bathwater</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/an-interview-with-tiffani-jones-brown/">An Interview with

    <li>Sara Wachter-Boettcher, <a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/on-content-and-curiosity/">On Content 
      and Curiosity</a></li>
    <li>Angela Colter, <a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/the-audience-you-didn’t-know-you-had/">The Audience You

    <li><a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/field-report-project-argo/">Field Report: Project Argo</a></li>
    <li>Michelle Legro, <a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/history-and-its-contents/">History and Its Contents</a></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Assistant editor at <a href="http://codexmag.com/">Codex</a></h2>

<p>Typography infiltrates all parts of our lives, from building numbers and street signs, to book spines and phone screens. It is a craft with a long tradition, and rewards those who are patient and sharp-eyed.</p>

<p>Codex was born out of <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/">I Love Typography</a>, a blog dedicated to making typography more accessible. Codex shares the same fondness for type and lettering, celebrates the people and tools behind the craft, showcases the elegant and graceful, safeguards the hard-won knowledge of the past, and keeps an eye on the future.</p>

<p>I have been lucky to work with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ilovetypography">John Boardley</a>, founder and publisher, 
  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/paulshawletters">Paul Shaw</a>, editor in chief, and 
  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/carywood">Carolyn Wood</a>, former editor in chief.</p>
